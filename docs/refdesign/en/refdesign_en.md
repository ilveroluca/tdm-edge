# REFERENCE DESIGN FOR WIDESPREAD SENSORS TECHNOLOGY 

One of the main goal of the TDM project is to develop and implement a scalable architecture able to gather, integrate and analyze data coming from heterogeneous sources of a wide metropolitan area. Some of these data will come from widespread sensor systems
on the territory. 
The project aims to realize a *reference design* to implement a general purpose platform able to manage remote sensors and to transmit data incoming to the cloud. This platform is called the *Edge Gateway*.

This document describes the hardware/software architecture of the Edge Gateway and of the components used to acquire and pre-process data coming from distributed sensors. Moreover, it is provided a description of the communication system for forwarding the gathered information to a centralized system to collect, storage and analyze data.
